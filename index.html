              I have tried to organize the talk from more general remarks
              (which I'll go over faster) to more specific remarks.
              Hopefully this will make the talk useful as an orientative
              source even if you are interested in other open source libraries
              and directly actionable for potential ArviZ contributors.

              This talk is mostly based on my personal experience and
              the challenges I struggled with when I started contributing
              to ArviZ, and that in fact, some I still face when trying
              to make my first contributions to other open source projects.

          <aside class="notes">
            I started programming with Python in 2013, right before
            starting my Bachelor. Then used Matlab and Python during
            my Bachelor. At that time I barely even knew what OSS was.

            Toward the end of my Bachelor I started using Git
            to version control some of my projects. That is,
            I used Git as a tool for completely linear version control,
            no collaboration, no branches...

            In 2019, I started contributing to ArviZ and learnt about
            Google Summer of Code which is how I got started in
            Open Source.

          <h3 style="color: #4b0002">How to contribute?</h3>

          <aside class="notes">
            Contributing guides generally focus on "how to contribute",
            sometimes covering a bit of the "what to contribute".

            However, even though I did struggle with Git branches and
            PRs, I struggled much more finding where and what to contribute.
            Still today, when we organize sprints for example I also
            have to dedicate more time to issue triaging _deciding
            what we'll have issue participants work on_ than
            on writing the how to contribute guide.

            One of the main issues with the "non-how" questions is
            that there are many possible answers. And all of them
            are correct generally speaking, but not all of them
            need to be right _for everyone_.

          <p>Learning new things</p>
          <p>Advancing your career</p>
          <p>Building a community</p>
          <p>...and more</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            There are many reasons for contributing to Open Source,
            and it is a question that doesn't directly define the next
            steps, but I think it is important to keep this in the
            back of your mind when considering the next questions.

            For example, if you want to build a community you'll probably
            be much better off in a community drive project, which
            values community related contributions and with a clear
            governance so you can after a while become part of the team
            or get to lead activities.

            If you want to advance your career you might be better off
            contributing to a library backed by a company you'd like to
            join.

            These dimensions might overlap, but the often do not and you
            could find yourself not reaching your goals or not having
            your work recognized no matter how hard you work.

          <h2>Where to contribute?</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            We have already discussed briefly choosing _which_ library
            to contribute to. So I'd like to focus this section
            on the _types_ of contribution.

            As I mentioned before, contribution guides focus on
            how to contribute, but we can generally be even more
            specific than that even. They focus on "how to
            contribute code".

            There are many, so many, more things that are needed
            in open source projects.

        <section data-auto-animate>
          <h2>Where to contribute?</h2>
          <p>Documentation</p>
          <p>Event planning</p>
          <p>Issue triaging</p>
          <p>Helping users/contributors on forums</p>
          <p>Code</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            It is important to keep these in mind too
            for multiple reasons.

            If your goal is to learn things, answering
            questions of the forum for the library
            is a great way to do so. A huge part
            of my current knowledge about Python and PyData
            libraries comes from having answered
            questions on PyMC and Stan discourse sites,
            ArviZ issues...

            Even if your end goal is to contribute code,
            you'll often need to dive deep into the
            codebase before being able to make the changes.
            You can contribute documentation while checking
            the codebase to start contributing from the get-go
            and keep the motivation up.

          <h2>What to contribute?</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            So far everything has been quite OSS general,
            not universal though.
            There are still some libraries that
            value code contributions only.

            Here I'll start being a bit more specific to ArviZ.
            In my experience, "what to contribute" is mainly chosen
            in one of these 3 ways

          <h2>What to contribute?</h2>
          <ul class="no-marker">
            <li>Issue browsing</li>
            <li>Issue finding/creation</li>
            <li>Issue direction</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            1st: browsing the open issues in the github repository
            until you find one that both catches your eye and
            seems doable.

            2nd: working on something you found yourself that needs
            improving, often opening an issue before actually starting
            to work.

            3rd: Working on something that was recommended to you.

            My first contribution to ArviZ was of the 2nd type.
            I ran into a bug doing something I needed to get
            done for my Master thesis, so I sent a PR with
            the fix.

            After that I moved to the 1st type for quite a bit.
            Especially for introverted people like me,
            being able to lurk and to not have anyone know
            how many issues I am discarding because I have no
            idea how to go about them is very attracting.

            If you already know the type of contributions you
            want to make, let's say documentation,
            then I recommend you browse the docs
            directly to find things that are not clear,
            try reproducing the code examples and see if they work...
            When you find something (when, not if because
            you will find something) then open an issue
            before starting to work. This will 1) notify us
            about the issue and your proposed fix and 2)
            signal to other potential contributors that you
            are working on this.

            If you are not completely sure or are considering
            multiple types of contributions, then
            you can browse the open issues to see if
            something catches your eye. However,
            note that ArviZ is a small library, and
            we don't have much resources to triage issues.
            If you don't find something it doesn't mean
            there is nothing for you to do. There are
            many pending tasks that don't have an open issue,
            there are issues that should have been closed
            instead, or even the labels might be outdated.

            If you like ArviZ and want to contribute to it,
            I'd recommend you reach out on gitter (or on
            an issue that is close but not quite what you want to do).
            Explain briefly what is your background and interests
            and we'll do our best to direct (or open and direct)
            you to an issue to work on.

          <aside class="notes">
            The ArviZ contributing page is an overview of
            many different contribution types available.
            And for each of them it points to some resources
            to help contributors learn how to go about
            that contribution type.

            I'll start with a small PR to ArviZ,
            then show two closed PRs as examples
            to better illustrate the PR dynamic.

            Here I'll go over GitHub centric cases only,
            docs and code to give a quick overview of the
            PR _dynamic_ which is an important part of contributing.
            But that doesn't mean you need to contribute to this.
            Both examples are on ArviZ, but even if not the
            same, the dynamic should be similar in most
            open source projects.

            This PR started after discussing documentation improvements
            on WriteTheDocs slack. Based on Gayathri's interests and skills
            I suggested several doc improvements I had on the back of my mind,
            and together we decided to work on the contributing guide
            landing page.

            After some discussion she submitted the PR which we merged
            after some review comments we merged the PR.

          <aside class="notes">
            This second PR example is a bugfix PR I submitted earlier this year.
            I have been contributing to ArviZ extensively for 3 years, submitting
            over 270 PRs.

            I continue to use the PR template, wait for the checks to finish,
            for someone else in the team to review (most of the times),
            also went back and added a 2nd commit to update the changelog.

            The template and checks can be intimidating, and any feedback
            on how to make them more clear and friendly will be very welcome,
            but they are there to help through the process!

            It is also a good example and a public service announcement:
            PRs more often than not require multiple commits.
            You need to be ready for review comments, for some check to
            fail and require changes...
            If you expect your PRs to be a commit and then be done with
            it you'll most probably be disappointed your PR might
            even be closed without merging.
